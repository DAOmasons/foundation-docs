# DAO Structure

## Gaining DAO Masons Core Membership

- To join the DAO Masons a prospective DAO Mason must:
  - be sponsored by at least one active DAO Mason.
  - have contributed to at least 3 completed projects including 1 Internal Project
  - complete the Ritual of Acumen
  - complete the Ritual of Oaths
  - receive a passed New Member Proposal vote in favor

## Losing DAO Masons Core Membership

- To lose DAO Masons core membership:
  - Voluntarily exit the DAO
  - An Inactivity or Bad Faith Demotion proposal passes

## Demotion

A Demoted member has voting shares converted to non-voting shares.

### Inactivity Demotion

Inactivity Demotion occurs when a member is not meeting the DAO Masons Activity criteria and a [Demotion Proposal](../Rules/glossary.md) passes to Demote them.

#### Activity Critieria

1. They have made an active contribution to at least one project within the last 90 days evidenced by receiving at least one share within a project.
2. Have participated with DAO Governance and/or Key DAO Decisions within the past 90 days.

We understand that there are valid reasons to step away from a DAO for a period of time and this Inactivity Demotion is intended to account for that and optimize governance.

### Bad Faith Demotion

Bad Faith Demotion occurs when the DAO agrees that a member is operating in Bad Faith. An example may be attempting to steal or divert DAO funds.

A Bad Faith Demotion generally implies that the former member should never be voted back into member status.

## Promotion

A member who has been Demoted can be Promoted with a passing [Promotion Proposal](../Rules/glossary.md).

### Gaining Contributor Status

Getting on the List:

- Sign the [Contributor Agreements](../Rules/glossary.md)
- Have one DAO Mason vouch for you

Working on the Project:

- One DAO Mason sponsors you for the project (Typically the Team Lead)
  - Sponsoring DAO Mason becomes responsible for filling in or replacing contributor if need arises
  - Redundant sponsorship is encouraged for critical roles
