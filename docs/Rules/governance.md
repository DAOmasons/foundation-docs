# Governance

There are countless organizational patterns we can draw inspiration from when designing our DAO. We choose an approach of decomposition to extract the parts we need from both sovereign (government-like) and contractual (corporation-like) organizations.

At DAO Masons we adopt a _decentralized alignment and accountability layer_ and a more _centralized management and execution layer_
to create a hybrid system that is the best of both worlds.

### Principles of Centralization

- When we choose to centralize power, it is ascribed to a role rather than an individual.
- The domain of authority for these roles are explicitly defined.
- Centralized authority is always nested within a larger decentralized power structure (checks and balances)
- Centralized authority is always interdependent with other centralized power structures (accountability to peers)

There will never be an omni-dictator with irrefutable power but neither are we stuck in a luke-warm miasma of consensus-seeking "equals".
