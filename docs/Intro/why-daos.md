# Why DAOs?

Our bureaucratic systems either still rely on paper documents and thus cannot scale to properly serve everyoneâ€™s needs, or it exists in the cloud and is subject to frequent hacks or leaks. They can guarantee neither safety or competence. Forget being able to offer a community self-sovereignty.

We spend more and more time online which has become a lot like the plains of medieval Europe. Roaming mobs burning witches and heretics at the stake (outrage culture, political polarization), people working as serfs serving only their landowners (Web2 Social/Gig/Content economies), and roaming bands of men on horseback who could skewer you and take everything you have (hackers, cyberwar).

What we need is walls. Shelter and reprieve from the chaos and violence outside. A place where outsiders have to ask permission to enter and can be ejected for wrongdoing. Where stone and mortar served in the past, we now have cryptographically secure, capture-resistant financial and governance structures.

Many of these needs are provided by traditional corporations. But engaging with those comes at the price of autonomy, sovereignty and dignity. New social and technological structures have emerged to create systems of distributed power that eliminate the need to become the equivalent of a serf in exchange for security.

These are DAOs. There will be many viable forms. And we, just like the Masons of old who built castle walls, can offer our hand at building DAOs in the vision of Web3, allowing the people inside those walls decide how they live their lives. This is a new renaissance.
