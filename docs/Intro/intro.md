### Why Now?

It falls on us to challenge old assumptions and become new engineers of human coordination systems. We do this for ourselves, our families, communities and the greater society. We do this by pursuing mastery over the fundamental mechanics of the new basic unit of human coordination: The DAO.

As happened in the middle ages, our current world order is crumbling. Our leaders and the systems they energize – once relied upon as incorruptible bastions of truth, honor, service and authority – have become corrupted and are no longer trustworthy as a whole. What was originally designed to serve the people and provide each with resources and opportunity, has been bent over time to serve more siloed agendas. 

The source, causes and nature of this corruption are beyond the scope of this document. The corruption itself is apparent and assumed. Our purpose is to provide a counterbalance to this corruption.

If you continue reading and find yourself aligned with the mission of the DAO Masons, we look forward to hearing your views, opinions and reasoned conclusions on this worthy topic.
